# Remember.exe in Unity
Recreation of the Remember.exe creepypasta in Unity.

## Information
This is a first project of mine to train my skills in Unity to then later move on to a future project, if this were to be abandoned I will publish the assets required to open this up in the editor yourself if you want to finish the game, I'll also provide the last models and textures required to finish the project.

## Issues
If you were to find any issues then please post them in the issues page, write which version you are using and let me know how to recreate the bug.
