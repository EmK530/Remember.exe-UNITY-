# Remember.exe in Unity
Recreation of the Remember.exe creepypasta in Unity.

## Loud sounds warning!!!
Remember.exe is loud and so will this recreation be, so please make sure to lower your volume by a great amount, make sure the ambience is at a low volume but still hearable, that should get you set. Don't worry, there's no punishment for unfocusing the game.

## Information
This is a first project of mine that I worked on shortly to train my skills to later begin making a real game. Since this is now abandoned you could pick this project up and finish it.
[Remember.exe Assets](http://emk530.cf/remember/dbpdata.zip)
[Remember.exe Converted Models](http://emk530.cf/remember/remembermodels.zip)
[Remember.exe Unity Project](http://emk530.cf/remember/RememberEXESource.zip)
If project does not load up correctly, note that the Assets folder was on my desktop and same with the Converted Models.

## Issues
If you were to find any issues then please post them in the issues page, write which version you are using and let me know how to recreate the bug.
